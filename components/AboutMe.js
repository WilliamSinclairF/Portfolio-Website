      I have a background in technical support and incidentally, this is what made me want to become a developer. My
      experience gave me a lot of empathy for end users as well as a deep understanding of what kind of impact software

      quality code with the goal of great user experiences. It also pushes me to keep an eye on how things could be
      improved.
