# Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to run the dev server and access the site on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. `npm run build` to build a production version of the project

## Technologies & services used

- NextJS
- Styled Components
- Vercel

## The why

NextJS was used to help with SEO and minimize the amount of extra stuff that the client needs to run to make things as snappy as possible. With that said, I also just felt like giving it a try since I had heard a lot about it and I'm glad I did as I had a fun time understanding it's tooling and the things it does differently compared to vanila React.

I opted to use Styled Components instead of a css library like Bootstrap and others or plain CSS because I love the developer experience that it provides. It just feels more natural to me to use components instead of classes. The project initially started with regular CSS but after a bit, I decided to scrap everything and made the switch and I haven't looked back since!

Vercel was used for hosting mainly due to it's current $0 price tag but the painless deployment experience is certainly a great plus.

## Future plans

I could spend hundreds more hours on this website and I probably will over the course of my career. However, I am currently focusing on my other projects as I really want to have at least a few of them online instead of only having code to show.

With that said, here are a few things I would like to add in the near future:

- More interactivity and animations
- A French/English language toggle
- Dark mode because of course
